### E-commerce Data Warehouse Design and Analytics

This project focuses on designing and implementing a data warehouse for an e-commerce application to perform analytics on sales and customer demographics data. The data warehouse is built using big data tools such as Hive, Spark, Sqoop, and HDFS. The project involves data ingestion, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, and performing Hive analytics to generate insights that can help in decision-making for the business.

### Objectives

*   **Data Ingestion**: Use Sqoop to import data from various transactional databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) into HDFS.
    
*   **Data Transformation and ETL**: Utilize Apache Spark for cleaning, transforming, and loading data from HDFS into Hive tables.
    
*   **Data Warehouse Design**: Implement a star schema design in Hive to model sales and customer demographics data, enabling efficient querying and analysis.
    
*   **Analytics**: Write and execute HiveQL queries to analyze sales trends, customer behaviors, and other business metrics.
    
*   **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation for setting up the environment, data ingestion, transformation processes, Hive schema design, and analytics.
    


### Key Components

1.  **Data Sources**: Relational databases containing e-commerce sales data and customer demographics.
    
2.  **Data Ingestion**: Sqoop is used to import data from relational databases to HDFS.
    
3.  **Data Storage**: HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) is used to store raw and transformed data.
    
4.  **Data Processing and Transformation**: Apache Spark is utilized for data cleansing, transformation, and ETL processes.
    
5.  **Data Warehouse and Analytics**: Apache Hive is used to create a data warehouse with a star schema for analytical queries.
    
6.  **Tools and Technologies**:
    
    *   **Hadoop**: For distributed storage and processing.
        
    *   **Hive**: For data warehousing and SQL-like querying.
        
    *   **Spark**: For data transformation and ETL processes.
        
    *   **Sqoop**: For data ingestion from relational databases to HDFS.
        
    *   **HDFS**: For distributed storage of large datasets.
        

### Features

*   **Scalable Data Architecture**: Designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently using distributed computing and storage.
    
*   **Comprehensive ETL Pipeline**: A well-structured ETL pipeline built with Apache Spark for transforming and loading data into Hive.
    
*   **Data Warehouse Schema Design**: Implementation of a star schema to facilitate efficient querying and analysis.
    
*   **Business Insights**: Ability to run complex queries to extract valuable insights on sales performance, customer segmentation, and trends.
    
*   **Complete Documentation**: Step-by-step guidance on setting up the environment, running ETL processes, and performing analytics.
